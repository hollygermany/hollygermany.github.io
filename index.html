    <p>
        My name is Holly, and I am thirty years old. I am a well-rounded scholar with a wide range of interests. I began playing the piano when I was four and took up the violin at the age of six. I was once able to perform works such as Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto, and some of my favourite piano pieces to play included Chopin’s <em>Scherzo No. 3</em>, Rachmaninoff’s <em>Op. 16 No. 4</em>, and Scriabin’s <em>Op. 8 No. 12</em>. I particularly enjoy playing chamber music.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am also an accomplished musician who has composed sonatas, concerti, operas, and fugues. From Year 2 to Year 6, I participated in Mathematics Olympiad programmes. I studied ballet for five years during my childhood, and I was also involved in track and field. I used to swim frequently, and I have always enjoyed golf.
    </p>

        During my time in secondary school, I liked reading books on physics, mathematics, and history. I later attended the University of Texas at Dallas to study computer science, where I served as an officer for the User Experience Club. In addition to this role, I won an internal C# programming competition with thirty participants. I also received both a Top 10 award and the Best Use of Google API Prize at a Texas A&M hackathon while I was a student there.
    </p>

    <p>
        While at the University of Texas at Dallas, I signed a seven-year contract to work for Rockwell Collins. I subsequently worked as a software engineer in various capacities. One of the most memorable modules I took at university was Digital Logic, where I learned computer engineering theory and hardware description languages such as Verilog and VHDL. I have since applied this knowledge in both private-sector and military/government contexts across several continents.

        In 2020, I had the opportunity to join the Master of Science in Data Science programme at Aberystwyth University in West Wales. During my studies, I wrote papers on algorithms, ethics, cybersecurity, databases, and deep learning. I gained practical experience working with MongoDB and Cassandra for the database module and produced a paper on convolutional neural networks for the machine learning module. The most valuable aspect of my time at Aberystwyth was studying ethics, as I believe it is essential in the modern world.
